This is the beginning of the data visualization project for Python Crash Course 3rd edition.
The files included have been manipulated for educational purposes and may not run as intended or
may not be as optimized as they can be. For all intents and purposes, these files are meant to be used
as more of an educational roadmap or coding passport rather than a "how-to".
